                <p>Hi, I'm Barry, I am a Senior Front End Developer. I have been working on the front end of websites for many years and really enjoy it.</p>
                <p>I love writing clean efficient code and keeping up to date with front end trends. I have more than 15 years experience working with HTML, CSS and Javascript and more recently I have added Angular to my skill set. </p>
                <p>Creating pixel perfect responsive UX layouts and components are what I most enjoy working on as well as investigating new techniques like css grid and investigating frameworks like Veu.js, Reactjs and Angular.</p>
