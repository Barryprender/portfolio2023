           <p>Hi, I'm Barry, I am a Senior Front End Developer. I have been working on the front end of websites for many years and really enjoy it.</p>
           <p>I love writing clean efficient code and keeping up to date with front end trends. I have more than 10 years experience working with HTML and CSS and more recently adding Javascript and Angular.js to my skill set, as well as HTML5, CSS3, LESS/SCSS, Bootstrap, GITNode(Gulp/Grunt).</p>
           <p>Creating pixel perfect responsive UX layouts are what I most enjoy working on as well as investigating new techniques like css grid and investigating frameworks like Veu.js, Reactjs and Angular.</p>
